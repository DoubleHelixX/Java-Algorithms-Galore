# Java-Algorithms
This was a special project I've done due to a Discrete Math class I had in college. I wanted to put the most notable Algorithms all in one program. The program itself has many validations and a menu of options to choose from. It is pretty lengthy code wise due to it being all in one program. A future update would be to separate it all in different classes.
